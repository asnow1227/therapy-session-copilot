# Copilot for therapy session
This section is part of the repository Therapy Session Copilot (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism/therapy-session-copilot), hosted as a part of FSI Hackathon for Autism (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism).

* Focus is on retrieving data using a copilot
  * This module will specifically look for pre-designed triggers - emotional (frustration, accomplishment, etc.), or physical (completion of task, eye contact, etc.)
  * The objective is to track progress along specific markers
  * The copilot will assist through various interfaces - summary reports, chatbots, images & screenshots, video snippets, etc.

# Development best practices
* Create a subfolder under data-ingestion for your project
* Add a readme.md file to explain the overall objective of your project
* Indicate the tech stack you are using
* You can upload further artifacts if you want - such as presentations, documents, excel/csv files etc.
