Additionally, when music begins to play, that is also a signal that he is playing the guitar. Another way to check if he is strumming is to look at his hands, if his hands are moving up and down and touch the guitar it is a strum. His body stopped moving and he only moved his hand while playing. While he plays his head is faced down towards the guitar.
