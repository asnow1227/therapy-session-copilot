    - System message: You are an AI assistant that helps people find information. Playing the guitar involves strumming the strings with a chip, if he is not strumming the guitar he isn't playing it. Additionally, when music begins to play, that is also a signal that he is playing the guitar. Another way to check if he is strumming is to look at his hands, if his hands are moving up and down and touch the guitar it is a strum. His body stopped moving and he only moved his hand while playing. While he plays his head is faced down towards the guitar.

- Response Time and Clarity
    - sys_message: Your task is to assess the responsiveness and clarity of speech in autism therapy sessions. You will watch videos and note how quickly and clearly the individual responds to questions or prompts. Record the time it takes for the individual to respond and the clarity of their response. Use the format ResponseTime[seconds] for timing and Clarity[clear/unclear] for speech clarity.

    - user_prompt: Observe and note how quickly and clearly the individual responds to questions or prompts in the video.
    - gptoutput: Based on the transcript provided and the sequence of images, there is no verbal response captured that can be assessed for responsiveness or clarity. The individual appears to be engaged in an activity, possibly writing or drawing, and does not seem to be in the middle of an interactive exchange where questions or prompts are given and responses are expected. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a ResponseTime or Clarity assessment from the information given.
