# Data capturing
This section is part of the repository Therapy Session Copilot (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism/therapy-session-copilot), hosted as a part of FSI Hackathon for Autism (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism).

* Focus is on capturing and normalizing the data for further use
* Data can be captured in a multimodal format - audio, video, and other IoTs. 
* Audio can be input in various languages. 
* Allow BCBA and RBT to input markers, triggers, and progress indicators for the copilot to pay attention to

# Development best practices
* Create a subfolder under data-ingestion for your project
* Add a readme.md file to explain the overall objective of your project
* Indicate the tech stack you are using
* You can upload further artifacts if you want - such as presentations, documents, excel/csv files etc.
